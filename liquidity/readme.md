## Impermanent Loss

Whenever you create a pool/provide liquidity to a pool, you can end up 
losing money in the long/short term.

### What is Impermanent loss?

Impermanent loss refer to a suitation where the compensation you recieve 
from allocating  a token in a liquidity pool is less than what you would 
have recieve just holding the asset.


This happens when a token's price changes in the market causing your allocating asset in the liquidity pool to become worth less than their 
present value in the market.


Let's say you deposit equal value of ETH and USDC into a liquidity pool:
1. 1 ETH worth $2000
2. 2000 USDC
3. Total value 4000

If people trade more in eth, and now you have

    10 ETH 
    1000 USDC

But now the price of ETH get decrease now you holds more ETH and less USDC


    Let's say inital pool - 1 eth price 2,000

    10 ETH  |  1000 USDC ---> 1000 + 10 * 2,000  = 21,000


    Now we have  people buy 5 ETH now the price of ETH is 4,000

    5 ETH | 4200 USDC --->  24,200



    Now If I just hold the asset then

    10 * 4,000 +  1000 ----> 41,000  


    If i just hold the asset i can able to make 41k 

    This is Impermanent Loss
